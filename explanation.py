# Steps to set up flask

We'll need the following installed for this tutorial:

    1. Python (this tutorial uses Python 2)
    2. virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
    3. Flask

We need to use `virtual environments to keep the dependencies used by different
Python projects separate`, and to keep our global site-packages directory clean.

We'll go one step further and install virtualenvwrapper,
a set of extensions that make using virtualenv a whole lot easier by providing
simpler commands.
